# Internals Viewer 2024

This is based on the codebase for Internals Viewer from 2007. The code has been upgraded to .NET Core 8 and I've started modernizing. I'll hopefully be able to refactor and extra testing to bring the 16 year old code back to life and up to scratch.

I've added a test winforms app to get it running. Once I've done a bit more refactoring I'll look into adding it in as a SSMS extension again.

After that I'll look into if any new features since SQL Server 2008 can be added, for example if Column Store indexes.
