# Tutorial

In this tutorial we'll create a database from scratch. We'll run DDL (Data Definition Language) SQL to create objects, then run DML (Data Manipulation Language) SQL to insert and modify data to see how we can view it and the effects on the database storage internals.

This tutorial will cover:

- Part 1
  - Connecting to a database
  - Viewing object allocations in the database
  - How to find object entry points

- Part 2
  - Viewing pages and records
  - How to view records
  - How pages are linked together

- Part 3
  - Navigating indexes
  - Heaps, clustered indexes, and non-clustered indexes
